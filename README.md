### Thanks for stopping by at my pageðŸ‘‹

My name is Nim Tayo and I am a Full Stack Software Engineer. <br><br>
The technologies that I use are:
  - Javascript
  - HTML/CSS
  - React
  - Redux
  - Node.js
  - MongoDB

I'm keen on details and a firm believer in teamwork and equality. I enjoy working in diverse groups and I always strive for personal growth. When I'm not coding, I enjoy taking walks with my dogs (we have 6 little chihuahuas in our household), Listening to music, and watching videos about new technologies that are out there. <br>

I am currently working on personal projects that helps me grow my knowledge for software engineering. I am open to new opportunities and would like to hear from you. <br>

My email is nimtayo@gmail.com <br>
